Android Rules:
You cannot nest Fragments in other Fragments with XML-Layouts.
You have to add them with code.
To insert a Fragment into another Fragment you have to use a special FragmentManager - a child FragmentManager.
You can get it from the parent Fragment.



Android project file structure TIPS:

I. Sensitive data
There are always some sensitive data in your project.
Whether it be keystoreâ€™s password or third-party API secret key, you want to keep it out of version control system.
You can put it in gradle.properties file of your project like below:

KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<your keystore's password>
KEYSTORE_FILE=<your keystore file>
KEYSTORE_ALIAS=<your keystore's alias>

Later you can use those properties in build.gradle file:

signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file(KEYSTORE_FILE)
        storePassword KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
        keyAlias KEYSTORE_ALIAS
        keyPassword KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
    }
}

Of course, you need to make sure not committing this file to VCS. But if you are lazy like me, you can put all those properties to gradle.properties file in GRADLE_HOME folder.
